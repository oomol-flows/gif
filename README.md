# GIF Processing Toolkit

A comprehensive collection of visual workflow blocks for processing GIF animations. This toolkit allows you to manipulate GIF files through easy-to-use building blocks without requiring any programming knowledge.

## What is This Project?

This project provides a set of **visual workflow blocks** that can be connected together to process GIF animations. Think of it like building blocks - each block performs a specific task, and you can chain them together to create powerful GIF processing workflows.

Perfect for:
- **Content creators** who need to edit GIF animations
- **Social media managers** optimizing GIFs for different platforms
- **Digital marketers** creating engaging animated content
- **Anyone** who works with GIF files and wants simple, powerful tools

## Available Blocks

### 🔄 **GIF Split**
*Extract individual frames from a GIF animation*

**What it does:** Takes a GIF file and breaks it down into individual image frames
- **Input:** GIF file
- **Output:** Multiple image files (PNG, JPG, or BMP format)
- **Use case:** When you need to edit specific frames or convert GIF to image sequence

### 📐 **GIF Resize**
*Resize GIF animation by dimensions or percentage*

**What it does:** Changes the size of your GIF animation
- **Resize options:** Set specific width/height, scale by percentage, or maintain aspect ratio
- **Quality control:** Choose from different resampling methods for best quality
- **Use case:** Optimizing GIFs for different platforms or reducing file size

### 🎬 **GIF Compose**
*Combine multiple images into an animated GIF*

**What it does:** Creates a GIF animation from a series of images
- **Input:** Multiple image files
- **Controls:** Set frame duration, loop count, and timing
- **Use case:** Creating GIFs from photo sequences or illustrations

### ↩️ **GIF Reverse**
*Reverse the playback order of GIF frames*

**What it does:** Plays your GIF animation backwards
- **Simple operation:** One-click reversal
- **Preserves quality:** No quality loss during reversal
- **Use case:** Creating "boomerang" effects or artistic reversed animations

### ⚡ **GIF Speed**
*Adjust GIF playback speed by FPS or multiplier*

**What it does:** Makes your GIF faster or slower
- **Speed control:** Use multipliers (2x faster, 0.5x slower) or set specific FPS
- **Precise timing:** Fine-tune animation speed for perfect timing
- **Use case:** Speeding up slow processes or slowing down fast action

### ✂️ **GIF Crop**
*Crop GIF animation to a specified rectangular area*

**What it does:** Cuts out a rectangular section from your GIF
- **Precise control:** Set exact coordinates and dimensions
- **Maintains animation:** All frames are cropped consistently
- **Use case:** Focusing on specific parts of the animation or removing unwanted areas

### 🗜️ **GIF Optimize**
*Optimize GIF file size by reducing colors and frames*

**What it does:** Reduces file size while maintaining visual quality
- **Optimization levels:** Choose from basic, medium, or aggressive compression
- **Color reduction:** Reduce color palette to decrease file size
- **Frame reduction:** Remove frames to reduce file size and increase speed
- **Analytics:** See exactly how much space you saved
- **Use case:** Preparing GIFs for web upload or meeting file size limits

## How to Use

1. **Select your blocks:** Choose the processing blocks you need for your task
2. **Connect them together:** Chain blocks in the order you want processing to occur
3. **Configure settings:** Adjust parameters like size, speed, quality for each block
4. **Run your workflow:** Process your GIF files automatically
5. **Get results:** Receive your processed GIF files ready to use

## Common Workflows

### 📱 **Social Media Optimization**
`GIF Input → Resize → Optimize → Output`
- Resize to platform requirements
- Optimize for fast loading

### 🎨 **Creative Effects**
`GIF Input → Reverse → Speed Adjust → Output`
- Create boomerang effects
- Fine-tune timing

### ✂️ **Content Editing**
`GIF Input → Crop → Resize → Optimize → Output`
- Focus on important areas
- Prepare for different platforms

### 🔧 **GIF Analysis & Reconstruction**
`GIF Input → Split → (Edit Frames) → Compose → Output`
- Extract frames for detailed editing
- Rebuild with custom timing

## File Formats Supported

- **Input:** GIF files
- **Output:** GIF files, PNG, JPG, BMP (depending on the block)
- **Quality:** Maintains original quality unless optimization is specifically requested

## Technical Benefits

- **No programming required:** Visual workflow interface
- **Batch processing:** Handle multiple files efficiently
- **Quality preservation:** Smart algorithms maintain visual fidelity
- **Format flexibility:** Support for multiple image formats
- **Precise control:** Fine-tune every aspect of your GIF processing
